Find My Simple
##############

Overview
********

The Find My Simple sample demonstrates how to use basic features of the Find My stack like Play Sound and Unwanted Tracking (UT) Detection features.

When the application starts, it enables the Find My stack.
From now on, the accessory is discoverable by the Find My iOS application.

If the accessory is unpaired, you can pair with it using the mobile application.
Note that the FMN advertising in the Unpaired state times out after 10 minutes.
To trigger the advertising again, press **Button 1**.

If the accessory is paired, you can track its location using the Find My application.
You can also use the app interface to play a sound on the device.
**LED 1** on the accessory indicates the play sound action.

To reset the accessory to default factory settings, press **Button 4** during the application boot-up.

The sample uses the background device firmware upgrade (DFU) solution called Unified Accessory Restore Protocol (UARP) which is compatible with the Find My iOS application.

Testing
=======

After provisioning the MFi tokens to your development kit and programming it, complete the following steps to test the sample:

1. Connect to the kit that runs this sample with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY).
   See `How to connect with PuTTY for the required settings <https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_testing.html#how-to-connect-with-putty>`_.
