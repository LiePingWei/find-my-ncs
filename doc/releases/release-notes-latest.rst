Known issues and limitations
****************************

* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the Release configuration due to memory limitations.
* nRF5340 SoC supports a maximum transmit power of 3 dBm, violating the Find My specification requirement for 4 dBm.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require a waiver for Find My qualification.
* Firmware updates of the nRF5340 network core are not supported with the UARP protocol.

.. TODO:
  1. Before the release, make sure that all TODO items in the 'release-notes-latest.rst' file are fulfilled and deleted.
